<h1>Sign in</h1>
<div class="login-stackÂ ">
  <a href="/login/google">Sign in with Google</a>
</div>
<p></p>

  its actually crazy if you would still require users to enter an invite code
  because then i can make sure they have a contact address and dont have to
  worry about having a footer

<style>
  .login-stack {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
</style>
